    "# 11.4 Activity: Producer-Consumer Model Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name: Congxin (David) Xu\n",
    "- Computing ID: cx2rx\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement\n",
    "Assume you were writing code that simulates a producer-consumer model (e.g., \"add\" and \"remove\" methods for a queue—the \"add\" method adds items to the queue; you cannot add if the queue becomes full; the \"remove\" method removes items from the queue; you cannot remove if the queue becomes empty). Come up with your own scenario. Write code for the equivalent \"add\" and \"remove\" methods in your scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify clearly what your shared resource (or resources, if applicable) is (e.g., a queue, an integer variable, a string...)\n",
    "- Use locks [acquire() and release()]\n",
    "- Use try-finally code structure [remember, where do call the acquire() and release() lock methods?]\n",
    "- Use condition(s) [using await() and notifyAll()] \n",
    "    - Note: You may have more than one condition and each method might have conditions—one method waiting on the other one \n",
    "- Comment your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario\n",
    "This is a fast food take out scenario. Servers at the restaurant prepare the food Customers pick up the food. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The shared resource is the variable `self.backlog`**, which stores the order that is ready to be picked up. Imagine this is the shelf where customer picks up their take out in store. \n",
    "- The total number of orders that a backlog can store is 24. \n",
    "- Each customer will make at least 1 order and at most 4 orders.\n",
    "- When the backlog is more than 20 orders, the server will stop preparing the order and wait for the customer to pick up until the total number of orders in backlog is less than 20.\n",
    "- When the order in backlog is less than the order customer wants to pick up, the customer will stop picking up and waiting for the order to be prepared."

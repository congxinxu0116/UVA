    "Given an array A[1, ..., n], with distinct values and k with $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. We want to return the k smallest element of A[1, ...,n], in non-decreasing order. For example: A = [5, 4, 6, 2, 10] and $k = 4$, the algorithm returns [2, 4, 5, 6]. There are at least the following four approaches:\n",

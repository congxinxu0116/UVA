    "Our research partners are in need of our help to analyze `NIH All of Us COPE` survey data. They are about to launch a new survey and want \"to anticipate, based on previous survey results, places where we might expect issues or challenges when we launch the new survey\". Specific items like: response counts, skip rates, and response frequency distribution for each question should be included along with any other metrics you can think of that will help the researchers identify questions that are potentially problematic (e.g, low response rates, no variability). If they identify questions (or wording of questions) that don't provide much information they will be able to update/modify the questions on the new survey to help get better information."

Since `Parent code` and `PMI code` did not directly correspond to the questions and answers given in the survey data, it was impossible to do a simple merge/join through either SQL or pandas. I was able to fix this by automating the data joining process, but also added a manual element of sorting questions and answers that were given in <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/dr2/COPE_Survey_NIH_All_of_Us_Clean_4.27.20.pdf\"> this link. </a> <br>\n",

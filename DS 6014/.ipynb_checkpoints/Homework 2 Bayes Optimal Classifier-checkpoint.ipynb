    "The authors in [1] describe a marketing campaign by a bank in Portugal. Modify the `Exercise3.2LDAQDA_IrisSoution` python code to use the data (`bank-full.csv`) from this marketing campaign with only the predictor variables age, balance, and duration and the response variable, y, to create the Bayes optimal  classifiers for each of the conditions listed below. Provide your python code for each of these cases.\n",

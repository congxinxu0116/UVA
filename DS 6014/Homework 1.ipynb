    "### Question 1\n",
    "(20) You are a data science and are choosing between three approaches, A, B, and C, to a problem. With approach A, you will spend a total of **four** days coding and running an algorithm and it will not produce useful results. With approach B, you will spend a total of **three** days coding and running an algorithm and it will not produce useful results. With approach C, you will spend **one** day coding and running an algorithm and it will give the results you are looking for. You are equally likely to choose among unselected options. What is the expected time in days for you to obtain the results you are looking for? What is the variance on this time"

    "To create a table in a markdown cell, I recommend using the markdown table generator here: https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables. This interface allows you to choose the number of rows and columns, fill in those rows and colums, and push the \"generate\" button. The website will display markdown table code that looks like:\n",

    "| Monday    | 74   | No   |\n",
    "| Tuesday   | 58   | Yes  |\n",
    "| Wednesday | 76   | No   |\n",
    "```\n",
    "Copy the markdown code and paste it into a markdown cell in your notebook. Markdown will read the code and display a table that looks like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "To put an image into a markdown cell in a Jupyter notebook, save the image as a .png or .jpg file in the same folder where you have saved your Jupyter notebook, and use markdown code that looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "![](imagefile.png)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where you will need to replace `imagefile.png` with the name of your own image file. Alternatively, if you want to control the size of the image in your notebook, type the following code on its own line in the markdown cell:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<img src=\"imagefile.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "```\n",

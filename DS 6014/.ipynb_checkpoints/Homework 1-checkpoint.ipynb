    "### Question 1\n",
    "(20) You are a data science and are choosing between three approaches, A, B, and C, to a problem. With approach A, you will spend a total of **four** days coding and running an algorithm and it will not produce useful results. With approach B, you will spend a total of **three** days coding and running an algorithm and it will not produce useful results. With approach C, you will spend **one** day coding and running an algorithm and it will give the results you are looking for. You are equally likely to choose among unselected options. What is the expected time in days for you to obtain the results you are looking for? What is the variance on this time"

    "(20) You have started an online business selling books that are of interest to your customers. A publisher has just given you a large book with photos from famous 20th century photographers. You think this book will appeal to people who have bought art books, history books, and coffee table books. In an initial offering of the new book, you collect data on purchases of the new\n",
    "book and combine these data with data from the past purchases (see ArtHistBooks.csv). Use Bayesian analysis to give the posterior probabilities for purchases of art books, history books, and coffee table books, as well as, the separate probabilities for purchases of the new book, given each possible combination of prior purchases of art books, history books, and coffee table books. Do this by first using beta priors with values of the hyperparameters that represent lack of prior information. Then compute these probabilities again with beta priors that show strong weighting for low likelihood of a book purchase. Compare your results.\n"

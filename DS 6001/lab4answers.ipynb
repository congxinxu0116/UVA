You will also practice using a library made specifically to wrap around `requests` to make calling from the Genius API easier.\n",

    "## Problem 1\n",
    "The Genius API documentation is here: https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1. Read through the documentation carefully. Although the Genius API is free and public, it still requires users an access key to use the API. In this case, Genius provides users with three codes: a client ID, a client ID secret, and a client access token. Use the documentation to find a way to obtain these codes for yourself. Write a paragraph that describes all of the steps you needed to take (but DO NOT list your access codes in this paragraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hints and cautions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Before you can use the API, you will need a regular, free user account with Genius. Sign-up here: https://genius.com/signup_or_login\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Genius's API is built to support third-party app development, not data scientists. The language is entirely geared toward app development. Under \"Authentication\" there are instructions to third-party developers for guiding their own users in getting access keys. That's not relevant to getting access for yourself. It's not hard to get an access key, but the guidance here is not very clear. Be patient and read everything in the Authentication section carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you arrive at the page that allows you to register for API access keys, the language is still geared toward app development. You will be prompted to name your app and provide the URLs associated with the app. It doesn't much matter what you name your app, and I just used the Collab main page (https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal?containerLogin=true) for the URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When you get your codes, copy them in a text file. In problem 2 you will copy these codes over again to a `.env` file. [4 points]"

    "In the \"Authentication\" section of the API documentation, I noticed the following language in the right-hand frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Access for Apps Without Users: If your application doesn't include user-specific behaviors you can use the client access token associated with your API instead of tokens for authenticated users. These tokens are only valid for read-only endpoints that are not restricted by a required scope. You can get a client access token by clicking \"Generate Access Token\" on the API Client management page.\n",
    "\n",
    "My app will not have users (other than myself), so this language applies to me. This paragraph tells me I can use my own access keys. Further it tells me to click \"Generate Access Token\" on the API Client management page. But where is the API Client management page? I look around the documentation and see \"Manage Clients\" at the top of the toolbar to the left of the screen. Sure enough, that takes me to a page in which I can click on \"New API Client\", then I arrive at the page to name my app. I called my app \"Class Example\", and I placed https://collab.its.virginia.edu/portal?containerLogin=true in the next three fields. On the next page, I copy the client ID and the client secret to a text file. I click \"Generate Access Token\" and copy the code that appears to the same text file."
